## `Saronic` 

I currently work at Saronic, building an autonomy system that will be deployed across all our platforms.

## `Shield AI`

### `XQ-58`

After many test flights through government programs, we shifted our focus to building an "AI Pilot" product that would be extensible to multiple DOD customers looking to deploy Collaborative Combat Aircraft. To prove out the product, we chose to partner with Kratos and test on their XQ-58 platform. I was one of the first engineers assigned to this effort, and laid the foundations for the autonomy system accross many mission types.

### `X-62 VISTA`

After successfully proving out RL techniques for simulated combat, we moved to mature our autonomy software and test on real fighter jets. Through contracts with DARPA and AFRL, we completed many successful test flights on the X-62 VISTA. I mainly focused on two areas:

1. Human - Robot Teaming
2. Expanding to additional engagement types, including beyond visual range and suppression of enemy air defense.

## `Heron Systems`

### `DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials`

I started my career at Heron Systems working on the DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials. Inspired by OpenAI and Deepmind's recent successes in Starcraft and Dota 2, we implemented a Reinforcement Learning + League Play approach. This proved to be very successful - we won every stage of the competition, including beating a human pilot 5-0 in VR. 

One year after the trials, Heron Systems was aquired by Shield AI, forming Shield's "Integrated AI" division.
