## `Shield AI: 2021-2023` 
At Shield, I worked on aerial autonomy software that was deployed to two autonomy test platforms.

### `XQ-58`

After successful test flights on the VISTA, I became a founding engineer for our "AI Pilot" product to develop an extensible autonomy solution for the DOD. To prove out the product, we partnered with Kratos and deployed on their XQ-58 platform.

### `X-62 VISTA`

I worked to mature our autonomy software and test on real jets. Through contracts with DARPA and AFRL, we completed several successful test flights on the X-62 VISTA. I mainly developing autonomy for:

1. Autonomous beyond visual range combat using IRST sensors
2. Suppression of enemy air defense

## `Heron Systems: 2019-2021`

### `DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials`

I started my career at Heron Systems working on the DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials. Inspired by OpenAI and Deepmind's success in Starcraft and Dota 2, we went all in on a Reinforcement Learning solution. This proved to be very successful - we won every stage of the competition, including beating a human pilot 5-0 in VR. 

In 2021, Heron Systems was acquired by Shield AI.
