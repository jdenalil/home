## *Saronic: 2023-* 

I currently work at Saronic, building a core autonomy stack that is deployed across all our autonomous surface vessels. 

## *Shield AI: 2021-2023*
At Shield, I worked on autonomy software for Collaborative Combat Aircraft.

### [*X-62 VISTA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_X-62_VISTA)

Worked on contracts with DARPA and AFRL to demonstrate autonomous combat missions on a modified F-16 platform. I mainly developed autonomy and tactics for:

1. Within visual range combat
2. Beyond visual range combat with IRST sensors
3. Suppression of enemy air defense

### [*XQ-58*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_XQ-58_Valkyrie)

Built the core motion planning and tactics management software for the Valkyrie, a multi-role autonomous fighter platform.

## *Heron Systems: 2019-2021*

### [*DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_AlphaDogfight)

Started my career at Heron Systems working on the DARPA Alpha Dogfight Trials. Inspired by OpenAI and Deepmind's success in Starcraft and Dota 2, we built a Reinforcement Learning agent that won every stage of the competition, including beating a human pilot 5-0 in Virtual Reality. In 2021, Heron Systems was acquired by Shield AI.
